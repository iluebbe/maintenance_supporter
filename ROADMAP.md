# Roadmap

Planned and proposed features for **Maintenance Supporter**. This is a living
document — priorities shift with user feedback (issues and Discussions).
Nothing here is a dated promise; items ship when they're ready and well-tested.
Shipped features are recorded in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Near-term (planned)

### ✅ LLM setup assistant — a skill that configures the integration for you
**Shipped** as a portable skill/playbook in
[`skills/maintenance-setup-assistant/`](skills/maintenance-setup-assistant/)
(SKILL.md + WS-API contract + discovery heuristics + non-smart catalog with
derived-usage-sensor recipes). A guided skill (Claude Code / Assist / an
MCP-style agent) that stands the integration up correctly from a conversation,
instead of the user clicking through the config flow object-by-object. The skill:

1. **Authenticate to Home Assistant** — obtain (or be given) a long-lived
   access token and the base URL; verify it can reach the WS/REST API. Never
   store the token in plain text where it can leak; treat it like a password.
2. **Discover maintenance candidates** — scan the HA device & entity registries
   for things that plausibly need upkeep: pumps, filters, HVAC, printers,
   vehicles (odometer/`device_class: distance`), water softeners, appliances,
   anything exposing a wear-signal sensor (runtime hours, cycle counters,
   pressure/flow, battery/consumable levels). Group by area/device and propose a
   ranked list of objects + suggested tasks with sensible default intervals and
   trigger types (threshold / counter-delta / runtime) inferred from the sensor.
   - **Also propose *non-smart* devices** — common household items that never
     appear in the registry but still need maintenance (range hood filter,
     dishwasher/washing-machine cleaning, smoke-detector batteries, HVAC filter,
     descaling the kettle/coffee machine, gutter cleaning, …). Offer these from a
     curated catalog as time-based tasks. Where a smart signal *can* stand in for
     usage, suggest a **derived usage sensor**: infer run-cycles or on-time from
     a smart-plug's **power draw** (threshold/state-change on wattage) or from a
     **presence/occupancy** signal, so an otherwise "dumb" appliance still gets
     usage-based (counter/runtime) triggers instead of a pure calendar interval.
3. **Match manuals & intervals (opt-in)** — when the user wants it, look up the
   manufacturer/model (from the device registry) to suggest a documentation URL
   or manufacturer-recommended service intervals, and attach them via the
   Documents feature. Strictly opt-in and source-cited; the user confirms before
   anything is fetched or attached.
4. **Create it via the public WS API** — drive `object/create`, `task/create`
   (+ `trigger_config`), and the global settings through the same WS commands
   the panel uses, so everything is validated server-side. Dry-run/preview each
   batch and get a single confirmation before writing.
5. **Verify & hand off** — after setup, sanity-check that entities were created
   and triggers resolve, then summarise what was configured and what needs a
   human decision (intervals it couldn't infer, sensors it wasn't sure about).

Ships as a documented skill/playbook (prompt + the WS command contract +
discovery heuristics) rather than integration code — the backend already
exposes everything it needs (56+ WS commands, entity introspection, documents).
Guardrails: confirm before every write, never invent intervals silently, keep
the token handling safe, and prefer proposing over auto-applying.

### ✅ Shared maintenance — multiple assignees + rotation
**Shipped.** Assign a task to several household members (`assignee_pool`) and
rotate responsibility automatically on each completion — round-robin,
least-completed, or random. The "currently responsible" user stays a single
pointer (`responsible_user_id`) so all existing per-user notifications and
badges keep working. Set via the panel task dialog + the options-flow edit
step.

### ✅ Native To-do entity
**Shipped.** A single global `todo.maintenance` list entity aggregates every
active task; item status mirrors due state (due/overdue/triggered →
needs-action, otherwise completed), and checking an item off completes the
task. Appears in the native **To-do** card and is reachable via
**Assist/voice**. Complements — does not replace — the panel and the Lovelace
card. Optional per-assignee lists can pair with rotation later.

### 💡 Multiple reminders per task + overdue escalation
Beyond the single "warning days" threshold: configure several lead-time
reminders (e.g. **14 days / 3 days / on the due date**) and an optional repeat
cadence once a task is overdue. Runs through the existing notification manager,
so rate-limiting, quiet hours, and bundling apply automatically.

## Next (under consideration)

### 💡 End-of-month scheduling (last day / last business day / ±N offset)
Requested in [Discussion #83](https://github.com/iluebbe/maintenance_supporter/discussions/83).
Extend the calendar schedule kinds with **last day of the month**, **last
working/business day of the month**, and a general **±N-day offset** on
calendar schedules — so cases like "the day before the last day of the month"
or "two days before the last working day" work without bespoke UI special
cases. Useful for monthly routines, reporting periods, billing cycles, and
meter readings. Builds on the nested `schedule` model (`helpers/schedule.py`,
kinds weekdays / nth_weekday / day_of_month) — a natural `last_day` /
`last_business_day` kind plus an `offset_days` field.

### 💡 "Meter reading" task type
Also from [Discussion #83](https://github.com/iluebbe/maintenance_supporter/discussions/83).
A dedicated task type for recording a value at a regular interval — meter
readings aren't cleaning/inspection/replacement/calibration/service. Start as
a new `MaintenanceTypeEnum` value (clearer in the UI, own icon); later it can
grow reading-specific fields on completion (recorded value, unit,
previous-value comparison / delta history), which pairs naturally with the
existing completion dialog and history timeline.

### ✅ Priority levels
**Shipped.** An explicit priority per task (low / normal / high) to sharpen
triage when many tasks are due at once — a priority badge in the panel, carried
through create/update on every surface (WS, 3 config-flow forms, task dialog),
and persisted only when non-default.

### ✅ "Missed" status + completion window
**Shipped.** Skipping an overdue task records it as **Missed** (a distinct
history type) rather than a deliberate skip — clearer history + compliance
views. A per-task `earliest_completion_days` optionally restricts premature
completion (the annual inspection can't be signed off three weeks early); the
complete/quick-complete WS paths + the To-do list honour it.

### 💡 Cross-cutting labels / tags
Lightweight tags (e.g. `#safety`, `#seasonal`, `#tenant-visible`) that cut
across objects, areas, and groups for filtering and reporting — orthogonal to
the existing hierarchical grouping.

### ✅ Warranty-expiry reminders
**Shipped** (opt-in). A daily check reminds once when an object's stored
`warranty_expiry` is exactly N days out (default 30, configurable 1–365 in the
panel settings). Routes through the notification manager (quiet hours, bundling,
dual service/entity send). Distinct from a recurring task's due date — it's a
one-off date on the object, not a schedule.

## Usability & design wave (planned, 2026-07)

Smaller, high-frequency wins first; each ships independently.

### Quick wins
- ⏸️ **Object photos as avatars** — the documents feature already stores images;
  pick one as the object's thumbnail in cards and the objects table. **On hold**
  (2026-07): unsure it reads/looks well at avatar size — revisit with a design
  mockup before building.
- ✅ **Duplicate task / object** (v2.14.0) — clone an existing task or a whole
  object with its tasks as a starting point.
- ✅ **Undo toast instead of confirm dialogs** (v2.14.0) — low-risk actions
  (complete, skip, archive) execute immediately with a few seconds of "Undo".
- ✅ **Snooze in the panel** — a "Snooze" item in the task more-menu routes to
  the existing NotificationManager snooze (suppresses reminders for
  `snooze_duration_hours`), via a new `task/snooze` WS command.
- ✅ **Bulk actions** (v2.15.0) — Select mode with checkboxes + bulk bar to
  complete/archive many tasks at once.

### Bigger building blocks
- ✅ **First-run onboarding + template gallery** (v2.15.0) — a "From template"
  button + first-run empty-state nudge opens the 13 templates by category.
- ✅ **"Today / this week" view** (v2.15.0) — mobile-first focus list (Overdue /
  Due today / This week) with one-tap complete.
- ✅ **Command palette (Ctrl+K)** (v2.15.0) — global fuzzy search across objects
  and tasks with keyboard nav.
- ✅ **Weekly digest notification** (v2.15.0, opt-in) — Monday-morning summary
  through the notification manager.
- ✅ **Printable maintenance report (PDF)** (v2.15.0) — per-object asset data,
  task table, costs; opens in a new tab to print / "Save as PDF".

### Design system
- 🟡 **Dark-mode & color-blind audit** — status badges carry a shape icon and the
  chart danger zone uses a diagonal hatch (v2.15.0). Status colours are now all
  routed through HA theme tokens (a tripwire test blocks bare colours from
  reappearing). Remaining: live multi-theme contrast QA in the browser (a manual
  check that can't be unit-tested).
- ✅ **Task-detail information architecture** (v2.15.0) — Weibull/seasonal
  analysis cards are collapsible with per-section remembered state.
- ✅ **Panel performance as a feature** — code-splitting (strategy chunks),
  `content-visibility: auto` on object cards / history timeline / Today list,
  and (new) a **genuinely virtualized dashboard task table**: above 120 rows
  only the scroll window is in the DOM (spacers keep the scrollbar honest), and
  a hidden sizer row pins the content-sized badge column so the shared subgrid
  tracks can't jitter while scrolling. Verified live with ~300 tasks: 36 DOM
  rows, byte-identical column widths at top/middle/end.

## Maintainability (internal, scheduled before the feature wave)

Refactorings that keep the codebase healthy as it grows — no user-visible
changes, but they gate how cheap the features above are to build.

- ✅ **Extract per-type trigger evaluators** — done: the coordinator's
  `_evaluate_trigger_fallback` dispatches to pure `evaluate_threshold/counter/
  state_change/runtime` functions in `helpers/trigger_fallback.py`, each unit-
  tested in `test_trigger_fallback.py`.
- ✅ **Move `_trigger_state` out of `trigger_config`** (v2.13.0) — dynamic trigger
  runtime now lives in the per-entry Store, reconstructed into `trigger_config`
  only at read.
- ✅ **Modularize the panel** — cohesive render clusters live in `renderers/`
  free-function modules: progress bars, history sub-view, and (new) the entire
  **task-detail cluster** (`renderers/task-detail.ts` — header/actions, tab
  bar, overview tab with KPI/meta/analysis cards, history tab) behind a
  `TaskDetailContext` of ~20 panel-owned callbacks. Dialog ownership stays
  panel-side by design, so the module renders into the panel's shadow root and
  never touches a dialog itself. The panel shrank ~2.9k → ~2.5k lines.
- 🟡 **Panel ↔ config-flow parity by construction** — the *global settings*
  surface is now derived from one `helpers/settings_registry` source (allow-list
  + ranges + options-flow selectors) and the notify-target list is unified.
  Remaining: the *task/trigger field* forms are still two hand-written UIs; derive
  both from a single field-schema source so a new field lands in panel *and*
  options flow automatically.
- ✅ **Parallelize the test suite** (pytest-xdist) — CI runs
  `pytest -n auto --dist loadfile`; per-test blob isolation
  (`_isolate_document_blobs` conftest fixture) keeps the parallel run
  deterministic.

---

## Exploratory (longer-term ideas)

- **Voice / Assist task creation** — create a task by natural language through
  HA Assist ("add maintenance: replace HVAC filter every 3 months").
- **Optional gamification** — per-user completion streaks / points for shared
  households, off by default.
- **Approval workflow** — manager sign-off on completions for operator /
  commercial setups (dovetails with operator mode).
- ✅ **Photo attachments** — **Shipped.** Attach a photo when completing a task;
  stored via the DocumentStore (deduped, backup-safe) and shown as a thumbnail
  in the history timeline.
